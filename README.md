# Tip-Calculator
## Phase 1 - HTML, CSS, and JS Fundamentals
One mock behavioral interview
Create a calculator where a user can input a check amount, select their desired tip %, and output their total amount due. This is basic math to get your brain muscles ready
Create the basic structure of the tip calculator using HTML and responsive CSS
Use JS to add the basic functionality to the calculator, such as taking input from the user and performing calculations

## Phase 2 - Frontend Details
Go through the "CSS Animations and Transitions" course on Front-end Masters
Introduce CSS animations, transitions and hover effects to the project 
One mock behavioral interview
Complete 1 challenge on Codewars every day

## Phase 3 - Frontend Features
Go through the "Functional JavaScript First Steps" course on Front-end Masters
One mock behavioral interview
Add creative features to the calculator using JS, such as a bill splitting function, the ability to round up or down the tip
Implement a feature that calculates the tip based on the quality of service (poor, fair, good, excellent) as selected by the user

One mock technical interview

## Phase 4 - Backend Functionality
Go through the "Javascript: The Hard Parts v2" course on Front-end Masters
Introduce backend development using Node.js and Express
Create a database schema to store information, such as who they split the bill with.
Store a history of each user's past calculations, including who paid or split the bill, how much everyone paid, and when
Based on this data, build the ability to calculate and recommend who should pay for the next bill to ensure fairness and equality among the group
Create an algorithm to calculate who should pay for the next bill

## Phase 5 - Adding Tests (the thing RC didn't have time to teach)
Go through the “JavaScript Testing Practices and Principles” course on Front-end Masters
Learn how to write unit tests for both front-end and back-end code
Implement automated testing with a framework like Jest or Mocha
Add tests to the existing codebase to ensure that it's working as expected

## Phase 6 - Integrating AI
One mock behavioral interview
One mock technical interview
Use OpenAI to calculate the tip based on the minimum wage of the location they are in to ensure they are tipping equitably

## Phase 7 - Migrate to React
Go through the “Complete Intro to React” course on Front-end Masters
Migrate the existing project to a React codebase
